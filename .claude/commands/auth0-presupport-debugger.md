You are running the **Auth0 Pre-Support Debugger** skill for Android and Swift/iOS SDKs.

Read and follow the skill instructions in full from:
`auth0-presupport-debugger/SKILL.md`

Also load the reference documents as needed:
- `auth0-presupport-debugger/references/android-checklist.md`
- `auth0-presupport-debugger/references/swift-checklist.md`
- `auth0-presupport-debugger/references/common-issues.md`

---

Start by asking the user:

1. **Platform** — Android or Swift/iOS (or both)?
2. **Symptom** — What is failing? (e.g. login hangs, callback URL mismatch, token error, crash)
3. **SDK version** in use

Then walk through the diagnostic phases defined in the skill, one at a time, asking targeted questions and checking their configuration against the checklists. At the end, generate the Pre-Ticket Diagnostic Summary from Phase 4 filled in with everything collected.
