## Getting Started

### Requirements

Android API version 31 or later and Java 8+.

> :warning: Applications targeting Android SDK version 30 and below should use version 2.9.1.

Here’s what you need in `build.gradle` to target Java 8 byte code for Android and Kotlin plugins respectively.

```groovy
android {
    compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }

    kotlinOptions {
        jvmTarget = '1.8'
    }
}
```

### Installation


To install Auth0.Android with [Gradle](https://gradle.org/), simply add the following line to your `build.gradle` file:

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.auth0.android:auth0:2.9.1'
}
```

#### Permissions

Open your app's `AndroidManifest.xml` file and add the following permission.

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```

### Configure the SDK

First, create an instance of `Auth0` with your Application information

```kotlin
val account = Auth0("{YOUR_CLIENT_ID}", "{YOUR_DOMAIN}")
```

<details>
  <summary>Using Java</summary>

```java
Auth0 account = new Auth0("{YOUR_CLIENT_ID}", "{YOUR_DOMAIN}");
```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Configure using Android Context</summary>

Alternatively, you can save your Application information in the `strings.xml` file using the following names:

```xml
<resources>
    <string name="com_auth0_client_id">YOUR_CLIENT_ID</string>
    <string name="com_auth0_domain">YOUR_DOMAIN</string>
</resources>
```

You can then create a new Auth0 instance by passing an Android Context:

```kotlin
val account = Auth0(context)
```
</details>

### Authentication with Universal Login

First go to the [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications) and go to your application's settings. Make sure you have in **Allowed Callback URLs** a URL with the following format:

```
https://{YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN}/android/{YOUR_APP_PACKAGE_NAME}/callback
```

> ⚠️ Make sure that the [application type](https://auth0.com/docs/configure/applications) of the Auth0 application is **Native**.

Replace `{YOUR_APP_PACKAGE_NAME}` with your actual application's package name, available in your `app/build.gradle` file as the `applicationId` value.

Next, define the Manifest Placeholders for the Auth0 Domain and Scheme which are going to be used internally by the library to register an **intent-filter**. Go to your application's `build.gradle` file and add the `manifestPlaceholders` line as shown below:

```groovy
apply plugin: 'com.android.application'

android {
    compileSdkVersion 30
    defaultConfig {
        applicationId "com.auth0.samples"
        minSdkVersion 21
        targetSdkVersion 30
        //...

        //---> Add the next line
        manifestPlaceholders = [auth0Domain: "@string/com_auth0_domain", auth0Scheme: "https"]
        //<---
    }
    //...
}
```

It's a good practice to define reusable resources like `@string/com_auth0_domain`, but you can also hard-code the value.

> The scheme value can be either `https` or a custom one. Read [this section](#a-note-about-app-deep-linking) to learn more.

Declare the callback instance that will receive the authentication result and authenticate by showing the **Auth0 Universal Login**:

```kotlin
val callback = object : Callback<Credentials, AuthenticationException> {
    override fun onFailure(exception: AuthenticationException) {
        // Failure! Check the exception for details
    }

    override fun onSuccess(credentials: Credentials) {
        // Success! Access token and ID token are presents
    }
}

WebAuthProvider.login(account)
    .start(this, callback)
```

<details>
  <summary>Using coroutines</summary>

```kotlin
try {
    val credentials = WebAuthProvider.login(account)
        .await(requireContext())
    println(credentials)    
} catch(e: AuthenticationException) {
    e.printStacktrace()
}
```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Using Java</summary>

```java
Callback<Credentials, AuthenticationException> callback = new Callback<Credentials, AuthenticationException>() {
    @Override
    public void onFailure(@NonNull AuthenticationException exception) {
        //failed with an exception
    }

    @Override
    public void onSuccess(@Nullable Credentials credentials) {
        //succeeded!
    }
};

WebAuthProvider.login(account)
    .start(this, callback);
```
</details>

The callback will get invoked when the user returns to your application. There are a few scenarios where this may fail:

* When the device cannot open the URL because it doesn't have any compatible browser application installed. You can check this scenario with `error.isBrowserAppNotAvailable`.
* When the user manually closed the browser (e.g. pressing the back key). You can check this scenario with `error.isAuthenticationCanceled`.
* When there was a server error. Check the received exception for details.

> If the `redirect` URL is not found in the **Allowed Callback URLs** of your Auth0 Application, the server will not make the redirection and the browser will remain open.

##### A note about App Deep Linking:

If you followed the configuration steps documented here, you may have noticed the default scheme used for the Callback URI is `https`. This works best for Android API 23 or newer if you're using [Android App Links](https://auth0.com/docs/applications/enable-android-app-links), but in previous Android versions this _may_ show the intent chooser dialog prompting the user to choose either your application or the browser. You can change this behaviour by using a custom unique scheme so that the OS opens directly the link with your app.

1. Update the `auth0Scheme` Manifest Placeholder on the `app/build.gradle` file or update the intent-filter declaration in the `AndroidManifest.xml` to use the new scheme.
2. Update the **Allowed Callback URLs** in your [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications) application's settings.
3. Call `withScheme()` in the `WebAuthProvider` builder passing the custom scheme you want to use.

```kotlin
WebAuthProvider.login(account)
    .withScheme("myapp")
    .start(this, callback)
```

> Note that the schemes [can only have lowercase letters](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/data-element).

### Clearing the session

To log the user out and clear the SSO cookies that the Auth0 Server keeps attached to your browser app, you need to call the [logout endpoint](https://auth0.com/docs/api/authentication?#logout). This can be done in a similar fashion to how you authenticated before: using the `WebAuthProvider` class.

Make sure to [revisit this section](#authentication-with-universal-login) to configure the Manifest Placeholders if you still cannot authenticate successfully. The values set there are used to generate the URL that the server will redirect the user back to after a successful log out.

In order for this redirection to happen, you must copy the **Allowed Callback URLs** value you added for authentication into the **Allowed Logout URLs** field in your [application settings](https://manage.auth0.com/#/applications). Both fields should have an URL with the following format:

```
https://{YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN}/android/{YOUR_APP_PACKAGE_NAME}/callback
```

Remember to replace `{YOUR_APP_PACKAGE_NAME}` with your actual application's package name, available in your `app/build.gradle` file as the `applicationId` value.

Initialize the provider, this time calling the static method `logout`.

```kotlin
//Declare the callback that will receive the result
val logoutCallback = object: Callback<Void?, AuthenticationException> {
    override fun onFailure(exception: AuthenticationException) {
        // Failure! Check the exception for details
    }

    override fun onSuccess(result: Void?) {
        // Success! The browser session was cleared
    }
}

//Configure and launch the log out
WebAuthProvider.logout(account)
        .start(this, logoutCallback)
```

<details>
  <summary>Using coroutines</summary>

```kotlin
try {
    WebAuthProvider.logout(account)
        .await(requireContext())
    println("Logged out")
} catch(e: AuthenticationException) {
    e.printStacktrace()
}
```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Using Java</summary>

```java
//Declare the callback that will receive the result
Callback<Void, AuthenticationException> logoutCallback = new Callback<Void, AuthenticationException>() {
    @Override
    public void onFailure(@NonNull Auth0Exception exception) {
        //failed with an exception
    }

    @Override
    public void onSuccess(@Nullable Void payload) {
        //succeeded!
    }
};

//Configure and launch the log out
WebAuthProvider.logout(account)
    .start(MainActivity.this, logoutCallback);
```
</details>

The callback will get invoked when the user returns to your application. There are a few scenarios where this may fail:

* When the device cannot open the URL because it doesn't have any compatible browser application installed. You can check this scenario with `error.isBrowserAppNotAvailable`.
* When the user manually closed the browser (e.g. pressing the back key). You can check this scenario with `error.isAuthenticationCanceled`.

If the `returnTo` URL is not found in the **Allowed Logout URLs** of your Auth0 Application, the server will not make the redirection and the browser will remain open.

## Credentials Manager

This library ships with two additional classes that help you manage the Credentials received during authentication.

### Basic

The basic version supports asking for `Credentials` existence, storing them and getting them back. If the credentials have expired and a refresh_token was saved, they are automatically refreshed. The class is called `CredentialsManager`.

#### Usage
1. **Instantiate the manager:**
   You'll need an `AuthenticationAPIClient` instance to renew the credentials when they expire and a `Storage` object. We provide a `SharedPreferencesStorage` class that makes use of `SharedPreferences` to create a file in the application's directory with **Context.MODE_PRIVATE** mode.

```kotlin
val authentication = AuthenticationAPIClient(account)
val storage = SharedPreferencesStorage(this)
val manager = CredentialsManager(authentication, storage)
```

<details>
  <summary>Using Java</summary>

```java
AuthenticationAPIClient authentication = new AuthenticationAPIClient(account);
Storage storage = new SharedPreferencesStorage(this);
CredentialsManager manager = new CredentialsManager(authentication, storage);
```
</details>

2. **Save credentials:**
   The credentials to save **must have** `expires_at` and at least an `access_token` or `id_token` value. If one of the values is missing when trying to set the credentials, the method will throw a `CredentialsManagerException`. If you want the manager to successfully renew the credentials when expired you must also request the `offline_access` scope when logging in in order to receive a `refresh_token` value along with the rest of the tokens. i.e. Logging in with a database connection and saving the credentials:

```kotlin
authentication
    .login("info@auth0.com", "a secret password", "my-database-connection")
    .setScope("openid email profile offline_access")
    .start(object : Callback<Credentials, AuthenticationException> {
        override fun onFailure(exception: AuthenticationException) {
            // Error
        }

        override fun onSuccess(credentials: Credentials) {
            //Save the credentials
            manager.saveCredentials(credentials)
        }
    })
``` 

<details>
  <summary>Using coroutines</summary>

```kotlin
try {
    val credentials = authentication
        .login("info@auth0.com", "a secret password", "my-database-connection")
        .setScope("openid email profile offline_access")
        .await()
    manager.saveCredentials(credentials)
} catch (e: AuthenticationException) {
    e.printStacktrace()
}
```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Using Java</summary>

```java
authentication
    .login("info@auth0.com", "a secret password", "my-database-connection")
    .setScope("openid email profile offline_access")
    .start(new BaseCallback<Credentials, AuthenticationException>() {
        @Override
        public void onSuccess(Credentials payload) {
            //Save the credentials
            manager.saveCredentials(credentials);
        }

        @Override
        public void onFailure(AuthenticationException error) {
            //Error!
        }
    });
```
</details>

**Note:** This method has been made thread-safe after version 2.8.0.

3. **Check credentials existence:**
   There are cases were you just want to check if a user session is still valid (i.e. to know if you should present the login screen or the main screen). For convenience, we include a `hasValidCredentials` method that can let you know in advance if a non-expired token is available without making an additional network call. The same rules of the `getCredentials` method apply:

```kotlin
val authenticated = manager.hasValidCredentials()
```

<details>
  <summary>Using Java</summary>

```java
boolean authenticated = manager.hasValidCredentials();
```
</details>

4. **Retrieve credentials:**
   Existing credentials will be returned if they are still valid, otherwise the `refresh_token` will be used to attempt to renew them. If the `expires_at` or both the `access_token` and `id_token` values are missing, the method will throw a `CredentialsManagerException`. The same will happen if the credentials have expired and there's no `refresh_token` available.

```kotlin
manager.getCredentials(object : Callback<Credentials, CredentialsManagerException> {
    override fun onFailure(exception: CredentialsManagerException) {
        // Error
    }

    override fun onSuccess(credentials: Credentials) {
        // Use the credentials
    }
})
``` 

<details>
  <summary>Using coroutines</summary>

```kotlin
try {
    val credentials = manager.awaitCredentials()
    println(credentials)
} catch (e: CredentialsManagerException) {
    e.printStacktrace()
}
```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Using Java</summary>

```java
manager.getCredentials(new BaseCallback<Credentials, CredentialsManagerException>() {
    @Override
    public void onSuccess(Credentials credentials){
        //Use the Credentials
    }

    @Override
    public void onFailure(CredentialsManagerException error){
        //Error!
    }
});
```
</details>

**Note:** In the scenario where the stored credentials have expired and a `refresh_token` is available, the newly obtained tokens are automatically saved for you by the Credentials Manager. This method has been made thread-safe after version 2.8.0.

5. **Clear credentials:**
   When you want to log the user out:

```kotlin
manager.clearCredentials()
```
